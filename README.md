# NickNamer
An android app that suggest names for hackathons, projects etc.

### The idea
We often struggle to come up with good names for teams in hackathons or names for repositories. Even in companies every system has a nickname sort of for example - search team at our work place was names as **Sherlock**. So, why not an app that can suggest these names to you!!

### How it will work?
We can curate these names of the internet from different websites. We can tag these names to category like tech, front-end, android etc. Users when open the app can be shown a random name from the list. If users want to choose a name for a category, we can show them a random name of that category.


### List of websites to scrape data from -

### Features!

We can start with very basic features of just showing a word and then may be extend it further as we develop. Some features that come to my mind are -

* Show a word spelling
* Pronounce the word
* Description of the word explaining the humour
* Category - For a word like IllegalSkillsException, the category could be programming
* More like this feature maybe
* Have a picture associated with the word - that can be put up on github maybe!
* Tell if the word is a common word or rare word - Something like Hackers is a very common name but IllegalSkillsException isn't
* Suitable for hackathon team names or for github project names.

##### Features Customized based on users

* Like a word
* Share the word on social networks
