# NickNamer
An android app that suggest names for hackathons, projects etc.

### The idea
We often struggle to come up with good names for teams in hackathons or names for repositories. Even in companies every system has a nickname sort of for example - search team at our work place was names as **Sherlock**. So, why not an app that can suggest these names to you!!

### How it will work?
We can curate these names of the internet from different websites. We can tag these names to category like tech, front-end, android etc. Users when open the app can be shown a random name from the list. If users want to choose a name for a category, we can show them a random name of that category.
